* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/gustavcorpas/gun-plus/issues).

Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.

* Before submitting, please read this document in its entirety.



#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the gun [community forum](https://chat.gun.eco/) and start writing code.

I write GunPlus in my spare time. I encourage you to pitch in.
